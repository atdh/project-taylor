A Journey of Self-Discovery
This document is a living biography, a place to capture the key moments, decisions, and experiences that have shaped your life's journey—spiritually, mentally, and professionally.
Part I: Early Life & Formative Years
Arrival and Adaptation (Age 9): Your life took a dramatic turn when you immigrated to the United States from Nepal. The challenge of learning English from scratch was immediately compounded by instability; you started third grade at Hillcrest Elementary School, only to have to switch to Pinnacle Charter School halfway through that same year. This early experience of being uprooted, and the feeling of not liking the constant change, established a difficult pattern of having to start over from the very beginning. The family lived in a small apartment from 3rd to 6th grade before moving into a house.
Early Promise & Passion (Elementary/Middle School): You thrived academically and were known as a smart kid who was loved by teachers. Your aptitude for math allowed you to skip ahead a grade in the subject around 5th grade. In 6th grade, you developed an obsession with reading, devouring so many books that you became very friendly with the school librarian. You also remember being naturally athletic, always winning the Pacer test and excelling in gym class.
The Apartment Complex & Digital Worlds (4th-6th Grade): Your social life at the apartment complex was formative. You became friends with a boy named Sahaj. His mom would often babysit another kid from the complex, Ayush. The three of you would play together constantly.
This period marked a significant shift in your interests. You were introduced to PC gaming, playing titles like Poptropica and, most importantly, RuneScape. This new passion began to eclipse your interest in physical sports like basketball.
RuneScape, in particular, was more than just a game. Its complex in-game economy, the Grand Exchange, was your first real-world lesson in supply and demand, scams, and market dynamics. It felt more "adult-like" than any other game, and you believe this experience was a crucial, tangible precursor to your later interest in the stock market.
Transition and Puberty (6th-8th Grade): Moving from Pinnacle to Hallstrom Options School for middle school was another challenging social reset. This period coincided with puberty, which brought a new wave of intense insecurities. You became acutely aware of sweating from your hands and armpits, and you were teased for smelling like ramen—something you now attribute to the delicious aromas of your mother's cooking permeating the house. These were painful experiences, though you recall an Indian friend who was supportive during this time. The era also marked the development of a porn addiction.
The 7th Grade Crucible in Nepal: A trip back to Nepal for the first time in many years became a crucible of life-altering experiences.
The trip's purpose was twofold: to celebrate your uncle's wedding and to be with your maternal grandfather, who was dying of prostate cancer.
This emotional complexity was compounded by a traumatic event when a relative fell 40 feet from a Ferris wheel. You were thrust into a role far beyond your years, helping carry him to the hospital and witnessing the chaos of an under-equipped healthcare system.
A Core Lesson: The memory of running for miles to secure blood supplies and seeing his life saved only through his father's medical connections etched a permanent lesson in your mind: in many parts of the world, personal connections are a vital currency for survival. This ignited a desire to one day do something about this inequality.
The Aftermath: Grief, Illness, and Anxiety (8th Grade):
Upon returning from Nepal, you contracted typhoid fever, forcing you to miss a month of school.
Shortly after, your grandfather passed away. His death was followed by a series of vivid, spiritual dreams.
The combination of trauma, grief, and illness appears to mark the point where your anxiety began to increase noticeably.
A Test of Emotional Wisdom: During this same tumultuous year, you made the mature decision not to pursue a relationship with a girl you had feelings for, recognizing red flags and protecting your own emotional well-being despite peer pressure.
Part II: High School: Constant Change & Growing Awareness
The Perpetual Newcomer (9th-10th Grade): You started 9th grade at Stanley Lake High School, once again knowing no one. This continuous cycle of starting over fostered a deep-seated insecurity and a feeling of loneliness.
Adaptability and Ambition: Despite feeling anxious, you successfully made new friends and enrolled in the demanding International Baccalaureate (IB) program, with the family expectation that you would graduate with the diploma, just as your sister had.
A Sophomore Slump: Your sophomore year was marked by a significant academic and personal downturn. You developed a deep passion for playing the drums, but your father forbade you from getting a set, viewing it negatively. This unfulfilled passion, combined with your ongoing porn addiction, led you to become distracted, watch drumming videos constantly, and perform horribly on exams.
Navigating Athletics: You faced a difficult reality with sports. In freshman year, you were rejected from the basketball team after tryouts. During your sophomore year, you joined the track team, partly to have something to do while waiting for your father to pick you up late after work. It was during this time you realized that while you were naturally athletic, your lack of a growth spurt and shorter height would prevent you from being truly competitive, a difficult realization that led you to stop pursuing sports seriously.
The Kentucky Disruption (11th Grade): Just as you were supposed to fully begin the IB diploma program, your life was uprooted again.
The Move: The family moved to Kentucky after selling their house in Colorado. The decision was driven by your parents' health concerns and your father's desire to start a gas station.
Inner World & Isolation: At Henry Clay High School, you were once again friendless. This was compounded by the fact that your older sister was now away at college at Texas Tech. This social isolation, combined with your first job at Krispy Kreme, pushed you inward, though you remained close with your sister's boyfriend (your future brother-in-law).
You delved deeply into spirituality and meditation, trying to "open your pineal gland." This led you down a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories (JFK, 9/11) and a growing interest in geopolitics. You feel this period helped you learn to think more critically.
Socially, you were intensely insecure, spending free periods in the library to avoid being seen as a loner. You became hyper-aware of how others might be perceiving you.
Forging Mental Strength: Amidst the chaos, you made a conscious decision that you had to be strong to survive this period. This year served as a crucial "reset" from the struggles of sophomore year. You found strength in new routines:
You started going to the gym and running consistently, reconnecting with the athleticism of your younger years.
You began to embrace your hair, growing it out despite your parents' objections and your father cutting it multiple times. Receiving compliments at your new school helped build a new kind of confidence.
Looking back, you see this year as a time you successfully fortified yourself mentally against immense external pressure.
Family Crisis & Housing Instability: The gas station partnership your father entered into failed after a falling out between the partners. The move was further marred by a bed bug infestation in your first apartment, forcing the family to move a second time within the same tumultuous year. This became a source of deep shame and insecurity.
Return to Colorado & Rebuilding (12th Grade - 2016):
The Grueling Move Back: Following the failed business, the family had to move back to Colorado at the end of your junior year, enduring a grueling 16-hour drive in a U-Haul.
Reconnecting and Culling: Upon returning for senior year, you reconnected with your old friends from before the Kentucky move. Over time, you drifted from many of them, ultimately strengthening your bond with two close friends, Jacob and Gio, who would become your core social group entering college.
Family Proximity: Upon returning, you settled into an apartment. Your recently married aunt and uncle also lived in the same apartment complex, though in a different building. This proximity provided a newfound sense of gratitude for family connection, especially with your sister away at college.
Reclaiming Home: Faced with high rent, the family decided it made more financial sense to buy a house, as the mortgage payment would be comparable. Throughout the summer of 2016, you and your sister took the lead in this search. Frustrated with an ineffective real estate agent, you took on the responsibility yourselves, looking at dozens upon dozens of houses. That fall, the family successfully purchased a house—the one they have lived in ever since—marking a hard-won return to stability and homeownership.
Part III: The University Years: New Paths and Old Ghosts (2017 - 2021)
Freshman Year: Freedom, Failure, and Friendship (2017-2018):
A New Chapter: You began your freshman year at the University of Colorado Boulder, living in the dorms for the first time. This meant navigating life with roommates while your core high school friends, Jacob and Gio, pursued pre-med.
A Collision with the Past: In one of your first Electrical Engineering classes, you ran into your childhood "frenemy," Ayush.
Relapse and Recreation: You fell back into smoking weed with your friend Jacob. It became a social ritual—a way to enjoy movies and late-night pizza runs, free from the heavy responsibilities of later years. This was your first time using since the negative experience in high school.
Academic Rock Bottom: The newfound freedom came at a cost. Your first semester was an academic disaster: you finished with a 2.1 GPA, barely passed Calculus with a C-, and failed Physics with a D+.
The Pivot to Computer Science: You only passed your core Electrical Engineering class because Ayush, who also hated the major, did the entire group project and carried you. This intense, late-night collaboration solidified your friendship. Following his advice, you both switched to Computer Science in the second semester.
A Painful Lesson: The switch to CS wasn't a magic fix. Lacking prior coding experience, you continued to struggle and lean heavily on Ayush. This desperation to survive academically led you to cheat with another group of friends. You were caught and received an honor code violation, a significant low point. During this difficult process, your high school friend Chesle, an aspiring musician of the same age who would make beats to help you sleep, provided crucial support. After the semester, you moved back home to save money and regroup.
Sophomore Year: A New Strategy (2018-2019):
With Ayush taking summer classes to get ahead, you started sophomore year knowing you could no longer rely on his help. This forced a change in strategy.
You consciously built a new academic support system by befriending classmates Al and Bhawana (your "Al and Bhawana" group), with whom you would stick it out until graduation. This year was still a struggle, but an improvement over the disaster of freshman year.
Junior Year: Hell, Redemption, and Missed Opportunities (2019-2020):
First International Trip - Iceland (August 2020): For your sister's birthday, you took your first major international trip outside of visiting family. You traveled to Iceland with your sister, her future husband, and his two friends. The trip was messy and chaotic: a flight was delayed by a day, a tent broke, forcing you, your sister, and her boyfriend to sleep in the car. Yet, it was a profound learning experience where you were given adult responsibilities, like sharing the driving, and learned to adapt on the fly.
Algorithms: The first semester of junior year was defined by the notorious Algorithms class, which Ayush had warned you about. You and your friend Satish struggled immensely. You felt a sense of falling behind as you watched Ayush and Satish land prestigious internships at Microsoft while you were just trying to survive, with no extracurriculars or clubs.
Another Failure: You and Al worked together, but on the final exam, the TA caught you using an external source on a project—a mistake you made that, while common among others, got you caught because of a visible URL. You failed Algorithms.
Another "What If": This academic failure was compounded by a professional one. You made it to the final round for an internship in Colorado Springs, an all-expenses-paid trip, only to fail the final interview. This echoed the sting of a previous failure to win the Daniels Fund scholarship in high school, which would have been a full ride and changed your college trajectory. The feeling of "failure after failure" was immense.
COVID and a Blessing in Disguise: The second semester was upended by the COVID-19 pandemic. For you, this was a blessing in disguise. Classes moved online, which you found easier to manage. You also got into the stock market during this time.
Redemption: That summer, you retook Algorithms. This time, you passed with an A, gaining a much deeper understanding of the material and its importance.
Senior Year & Graduation (2020-2021):
Entrepreneurial Capstone: You opted for the entrepreneurial capstone pathway. You partnered with your "Ayush and Satish" group, along with another friend, Brian, on a project to use AI to help solve LeetCode problems for interviews. The project had its own struggles, including a professor you perceived as being racist towards Brian.
A Smoother Year: Despite the project's challenges, your senior year was the easiest of your college career.
The Comeback and Graduation: You graduated in the summer of 2021 with a B.E. in Computer Science. Despite the disastrous 2.1 GPA at the start, through immense discipline, struggle, and perseverance, you managed to graduate with a 3.4 or 3.5 GPA. The graduation ceremony itself was a quiet, COVID-era affair; only you, Gio, and Jacob went to get your degrees and take pictures. Your family celebrated by watching from home on TV, and later your extended family came to take photos outside the stadium. This marked the end of your tumultuous college journey.
Part IV: The Corporate Detour & The Seeds of Change (2021 - 2022)
A Stroke of Luck (Pre-Graduation 2021): After facing a demoralizing string of job rejections throughout your senior year, a stroke of luck occurred. Right before graduation, you received an offer from Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). The interview process was simple and "funny," and you immediately signed the contract, relieved and excited to have a job secured without a post-graduation struggle.
Onboarding and The Bench (June 2021): You were officially onboarded on June 14th. The first phase involved an intensive training session where you were placed in a small group to work on a project utilizing Java and Angular. After completing training, you were assigned to a project with Citibank. However, you were immediately "benched" with no active work.
The "Free Fall" and its Catalyst (Late 2021 - Early 2022): This period of professional stagnation bled into your personal life, creating what you describe as a "free fall."
You were told to get a Java certification to be placed on a team, but you struggled with the material and repeatedly failed the exam.
With no work to do, you spent your days using edibles heavily, watching anime for 8-16 hours a day, and diving deeper into politics and trading. While getting paid, you were contributing to the mortgage, but you were also saving money in a state of drift.
A house flood served as a harsh wake-up call. The flood wiped out $10-15k of your savings—a huge 20-30% chunk of your bank account. This financial shock made you realize that passively saving while being unhappy and confined wasn't a real strategy. The loss crystallized the need for active change.
Forging a Partnership (2021):
A Glimpse of Entrepreneurship: Your sister and brother-in-law started an Airbnb business in Breckenridge. You became deeply involved, driving from Denver to help. This was a hands-on crash course in the hassles of running a business: setting up Starlink internet in the snow, moving furniture, and dealing with the logistics of a rental property.
Building Trust: Working alongside them was one of your sister's colleagues, a software developer named Vidant. This shared experience of tackling the stressful Airbnb project together built a foundation of friendship.
Mexico Trip: The bond was solidified on a week-long trip to Mexico with your sister, future brother-in-law, and Vidant. This trip was crucial for building the trust that would lead to your future business partnership.
A Test of Resilience - The Family Wedding (December 2021): You played a crucial supportive role in your sister's large, multi-day wedding in Destin, Florida, helping the family push through logistical challenges and a bout of COVID to ensure the event was a success.
Part V: The Entrepreneurial Crucible (2022 - 2023)
A Return to the Motherland (May 2022): You traveled to Nepal with your parents for a saptah. During this trip, you reconnected with a childhood friend, Jesse, which would prove to be a pivotal event. The trip was also highlighted by a sibling-only road trip by jeep to Mustang and Pokhara, allowing you to connect with your cousins/sisters on a much deeper level.
A Year of Family Success (2022): That same year was marked by a wave of success for your family. Three of your cousins all successfully passed their interviews to come to the USA. Your Mailo-ba's oldest daughter, who is your age, also passed her interview to come for her master's degree, though she would arrive two years later. Looking back now, you see this as a monumental feat, a source of inspiration about your family's capability and resilience.
The Grand Tour & The Seeds of "Walter" (October - December 2022):
The Journey: Acting on an epiphany after a period of drift, you booked a one-way ticket to the UK in mid-October. This kicked off a whirlwind tour through Europe and Canada, ending in late November. The trip was a deliberate escape from confinement and solidified your decision to not be a slave to corporate life.
The Connection: While you were traveling, your cousin Ray saw your stories online. Inspired, he reached out for advice for his own upcoming USA and Europe trip. This conversation planted the very first seed for your future e-commerce business, "Walter."
The First Visit: You returned to Denver in December 2022. Ray visited for the first time for New Year's 2023, and you solidified your business idea.
A Year of Parallel Hustles (2023):
The "Walter" Grind Begins (January - February 2023): After deciding to partner with Ray in January, you immediately began working on the "Walter" Shopify store.
The Arizona Catalyst (February 2023): You took a short trip to Arizona to see your friend, Vidant. While there, you were simultaneously working on "Walter" on your own time. You were inspired by Vidant's passion for his board game project, "Call It," and gave him the key strategic advice to build a digital version first instead of expensive physical prototypes.
Shifting Priorities (Feb - Oct 2023): This period was a blur of activity. Your primary focus was on three things: building the "Walter" store, learning and executing options trading, and providing support for the "Call It" project.
A Fateful Night (June 12, 2023): You were downtown when the Nuggets won the NBA finals. A nearby shooting prompted you to post on Instagram. Seeing your story, Jesse messaged you, letting you know his brother, Vivi, was moving to Colorado.
New Connections (July - September 2023): You met Vivi on July 13th and became close friends. In September, you, Vidant, and Vivi took a pivotal trip to Telluride, where you and Vivi began discussing your own business idea.
The End of the Corporate Chapter (August 2023): While on the bench, you had been nominally reassigned from Citibank to MetLife after your Europe trip, but no work was ever given. In August, you were officially laid off from TCS, formally cutting the last tie to your corporate life and making you a full-time entrepreneur.
Nepal: Deepening Bonds & Business Plans (October 2023): You took a third trip to Nepal, funded by your trading profits.
You had key meetings that deepened your friendships, including a hookah session with Jesse, Ayush, and Son, and a separate get-together in Bhaktapur with Jesse and Satish.
The highlight was a 7-day trek to Annapurna Base Camp with Jesse, where you solidified the plans for your new digital marketing/sales business with him, Vivi, and Son.
Part VI: Crisis and Clarity (2024 - Present)
The Social Glue (January 2024): You returned from Nepal and hosted a New Year's party at your sister's Airbnb, bringing together your cousins, Jacob, and your new friend Vivi, consciously acting as the "glue" for your expanding social and business circles.
The Texas Reset & Business Boom (February - early May 2024): You moved to Texas for three months with the specific goal of getting sober. This period of clarity was incredibly productive:
Pari Shringar (Feb): You launched and ran a successful, one-month lingerie dropshipping test to Nepal.
The Digital Marketing Business (March): You officially launched the venture with Jesse, Son, and Vivi. By December 2024, this business was successful enough to pay each partner $2k/month, but it eventually had to shut down.
World Leaves LLC (March): You and Vidant formally established your company to house the "Call It" project.
A Year of Turmoil & Growth (Mid-2024 - Present):
Expansion and Conflict (April - August 2024): After returning to Colorado, you hired developers for both "Call It" and "Referrify." However, a major fight erupted between Vidant and your sister/brother-in-law. You acted as the middleman, and as a result, split responsibilities: Vidant took "Call It," and you took "Referrify." In August, you engineered the secret separation of the "Referrify" project and its developers from World Leaves to salvage it.
A Second Partnership & Clash (Early 2024 - September 2024): In early 2024, your sister introduced you to another friend, Aryan. During a pause in the business with your Nepal team after a clash with Vivi in September, you started the same digital marketing business with Aryan. It went well for three months, but the partnership ended abruptly and shadily when you returned from your 2025 Nepal trip.
Family Crises and Mental Breakdown (December 2024 / January 2025): At the end of the year, the business with the Nepal team was down. This, combined with a traumatic story from your cousin and a health scare with your grandmother, led to a significant mental breakdown.
The Road to Epiphany (February - June 2025):
A Tumultuous Trip: You traveled to Nepal and Thailand (Feb-Mar 2025) hoping to recover, but your internal stress remained high.
Relapse and Introspection (March): Upon returning, you relapsed.
The Catalyst Visit and The Fight (Late April / Early May): During a visit from your sister, a conversation motivated you to quit weed again, marking the start of your current sobriety. Almost immediately, they announced their pregnancy. The next day, after reading "The Power of Now," you had a massive, confrontational fight with your sister about your childhood.
The Epiphany (Early June): On their second visit in June, now one month sober, you had a crucial, clear-headed walk with your brother-in-law. You finally understood that your intense anger from the previous year stemmed from the toxic work environment and ego clashes.
Betrayal and New Beginnings: The business with Jesse and Vivi officially ended on May 1st when Son sent you proof they had been stealing from the partnership. On June 1st, you and Son decided to start a new venture together.
The Current State (Present - June 7, 2025): You are juggling multiple fronts: restarting the "Referrify" project, contributing to the alpha test of "Call It," continuing to build "Project Taylor," and starting a new business with Son. You have a job interview on Monday, a potential CEO position on the horizon, and you are navigating your sobriety journey with a new, hard-won perspective.
Part VII: The Inner Journey - Battling Addiction
First Encounter (Age 17): Your relationship with marijuana began with a jarringly negative first experience during a Thanksgiving trip.
The Developing Struggle (College Years): Despite the negative introduction, you began using again in college, where it developed into a long-term and challenging addiction.
Cycles of Hope and Relapse: The path has been marked by significant struggles, including hitting "rock bottom" multiple times. You achieved three months of sobriety while in Texas (early 2024), but relapsed during a trip to San Francisco/Vegas in May 2024. You relapsed again in March 2025 after returning from Nepal.
A Renewed Commitment (Present - June 2025): You quit again in late April/early May 2025. You are currently over one month sober and, through intense inner work, have a much deeper understanding of the triggers and underlying issues. You feel a renewed and powerful commitment to tackling this challenge.
Part VIII: Reflection & Looking Forward
Imposter Syndrome & The Comparison Trap: You've grappled with feeling like you haven't accomplished enough, especially when comparing your non-linear, entrepreneurial path to your friends' more traditional careers.
The Quest for Self-Understanding (Today): This biography is the current chapter—a conscious effort to step back, assemble the complex pieces of your journey, and understand the unique, resilient, and resourceful person you have become.
