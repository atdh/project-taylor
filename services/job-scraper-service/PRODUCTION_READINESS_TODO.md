# Job Scraper Service - Production Readiness TODO

## 🎯 Goal: Make job-scraper-service production-ready in the next few hours

### ✅ Completed Tasks
- [x]The AI enrichment is now working correctly with cleaned JSON parsing, and the enriched job data is saved successfully with a quality score of 0.75 and processing time around 5 seconds.

Next steps:
- Continue comprehensive testing of all remaining areas in the TODO list.
- Update README and documentation as we progress.
- Monitor AI enrichment performance and optimize as needed.

- [ ] **Multiple Job Sources**: Test USAJobs, JSearch, Adzuna formats
- [ ] **Edge Cases Testing**:
  - [ ] Jobs with missing salary data
  - [ ] Jobs with missing location data
  - [ ] Very long job descriptions (>5000 chars)
  - [ ] Special characters in company names
  - [ ] Invalid/broken URLs
  - [ ] Empty descriptions
- [ ] **Error Scenarios**:
  - [ ] Malformed JSON requests
  - [ ] Missing required fields
  - [ ] Database connection failures
  - [ ] API rate limiting simulation
- [ ] **Performance Testing**:
  - [ ] Concurrent webhook requests (10+ simultaneous)
  - [ ] Bulk job processing
  - [ ] AI processing timeout scenarios
- [ ] **Existing Endpoints**: Verify `/api/search-jobs` and `/api/search-jobs-ai` still work

#### Database Testing
- [ ] **Query Performance**: Test searches on AI-enriched fields
- [ ] **Index Effectiveness**: Verify new indexes improve performance
- [ ] **Data Integrity**: Test constraint validations
- [ ] **Migration Rollback**: Test rollback procedures

#### Integration Testing
- [ ] **End-to-End Flow**: Job ingestion → AI enrichment → Search → Results
- [ ] **Cross-Service Communication**: Test with other microservices
- [ ] **Real Job Data**: Test with actual job API responses

### 📚 Documentation Tasks
- [ ] **Update README.md**: Comprehensive service documentation
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Document all endpoints with examples
- [ ] **Environment Setup**: Document all required environment variables
- [ ] **Deployment Guide**: Step-by-step deployment instructions
- [ ] **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions
- [ ] **Performance Metrics**: Document expected performance benchmarks

### 🚀 Production Deployment Prep
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Verify all required vars are documented
- [ ] **Error Monitoring**: Add structured logging for production
- [ ] **Health Checks**: Implement comprehensive health checks
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limiting
- [ ] **Security**: Review and implement security best practices
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Add metrics and monitoring endpoints

### 🔍 Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Code Review**: Review all new code for best practices
- [ ] **Security Review**: Check for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Performance Review**: Optimize bottlenecks
- [ ] **Documentation Review**: Ensure all docs are accurate and complete

### 📊 Success Criteria
- [ ] All endpoints respond correctly under load
- [ ] AI enrichment success rate > 90%
- [ ] Average processing time < 2 seconds per job
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation complete
- [ ] All edge cases handled gracefully
- [ ] Production deployment ready
